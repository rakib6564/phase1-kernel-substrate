# 14 — Architecture Decision Records

**Status:** Draft · **Applies to:** Slate v1.x → v5.x

An **ADR** captures one significant architectural decision: its context, the
decision, the alternatives weighed, and the consequences accepted. Over 10–15
years these records answer the question a future developer always asks — *why is
it built this way?* — so decisions aren't silently re-litigated or accidentally
reversed.

---

## The rules (from the [hub policy](../README.md))

- **Append-only.** An ADR is never edited away. When a decision changes, write a
  new ADR and mark the old one `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`. The reasoning trail is
  permanent.
- **One decision per record.** Numbered sequentially, never renumbered.
- **A new structural decision needs an ADR** ([15-Contributing](../15-Contributing/)):
  a new cross-cutting pattern, a boundary move, a technology choice, a reversal.
- **Statuses:** `Proposed` · `Accepted` · `Superseded`.

## Template

```
# ADR-NNNN — Title
**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-MMMM   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
## Context      — the forces and the real problem (cite the audit where relevant)
## Decision     — what we chose, precisely
## Alternatives — what else was considered, and why rejected
## Consequences  — positive AND negative; the trade-offs we accept
## Related       — ADRs and hub sections
```
