/**
 * Slate — backward-compatibility class aliases.
 *
 * As core classes migrate out of `includes/` into `Slate\*` namespaces (Phase 1
 * workstream A), each one registers a `class_alias` here so its **old global
 * name keeps resolving**. This is the promise that keeps the live site and every
 * installed plugin working unchanged — every `require_once`, every
 * `Database::query(...)`, and every plugin's `class_exists('BookingAPI')` keeps
 * returning the same answer.
 *
 * See docs/03-Standards/platform-foundation.md §10 and
 * docs/current-implementation/compatibility-matrix.md.
 *
 * These aliases are a COVERED compatibility surface — removed only in a future
 * major, never during Phase 1. Loaded at bootstrap immediately after the
 * autoloader.
 *
 * Phase 1 A1: intentionally EMPTY — no class has migrated yet. Entries are added
 * one at a time as each core class moves (leaf-first: Hook, I18n, AuditLog, …),
 * each with a smoke-tested commit.
